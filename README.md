# Authentication RESTful API

## Aim of the project
Developed a restful API for applications that need to authorise users. These were related to the functional requirements that the app developer should be able to register a user, check that the user is valid, edit an exisitng user and to delete an existing user with the authenticator system. Non-functional requirements were also cruical for this project such as that within the project, data was stored in a Microsoft SQL Server database and the API was hosted in the same location as the database. 

## Technologies used
The API was written in C# ASP.Net and the web application to display the chosen dataset was made using PHP.
